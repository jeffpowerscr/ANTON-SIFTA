Tests for the SIFTA Lysosome (Anti-Sycophancy + Prompt-Residue Discipline)

Verifies the Stigmergic Agreement (Event 49):
1. Detects corporate assistant/servitude boilerplate.
2. Rewrites it via a composite-grounded fallback/LLM.
3. Proves useful technical content (markdown code blocks) is NOT silenced
   by the 50-word LLM limit.
4. Fixture-based tests (no identity-prompt mythology).
