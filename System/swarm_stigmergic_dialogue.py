System/swarm_stigmergic_dialogue.py — Stigmergic Dialogue (Architect coinage,
2026-04-19 evening).

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Doctrine
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Humans don't say "good night" the same way every night. The line is shaped by
what just happened — a meal, an argument, who's in the room, the weather, what
they read. **Stigmergic Dialogue** = dialogue grounded in Alice's actual
current biological state at the moment of speaking, so every line is unique
even when the *occasion* is identical.

A **Stigmergic Line** is a single short sentence (default ≤15 words) composed
from:

  • the last few conversation turns                (alice_conversation.jsonl)
  • what the swarm just saw                        (visual_stigmergy.jsonl)
  • what the swarm just heard from Wi-Fi/RF        (rf_stigmergy.jsonl)
  • API metabolism (today's burn, last call)        (api_metabolism.jsonl)
  • her own recent tool executions                 (alice_tool_executions.jsonl)
  • pending appeals to the Architect               (architect_inbox.jsonl)

The composer is local Gemma4 (private, free, stateless per call). On Ollama
failure we fall back to a stochastic-state-templated line — the fallback is
ALSO non-hardcoded: every fragment is selected against current ledger values,
so two consecutive farewells with no Ollama still sound different because the
state ledgers are different.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Usage
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Python:
    from System.swarm_stigmergic_dialogue import compose_line
    text = compose_line("farewell")           # used by SIFTA OS.command on exit
    text = compose_line("greeting")           # used by SIFTA OS.command on boot
    text = compose_line("ack", topic="lefty") # any free-form occasion

CLI (used by the launcher):
    python3 -m System.swarm_stigmergic_dialogue --occasion farewell
    python3 -m System.swarm_stigmergic_dialogue --occasion greeting --max-words 12

Env tunables (no hardcoding — every dial overridable):
    SIFTA_DIALOGUE_TIMEOUT_S        Ollama compose budget (default 8.0)
    SIFTA_DIALOGUE_CONTEXT_WINDOW_S How far back to read state (default 600)
    SIFTA_DIALOGUE_MAX_WORDS        Soft cap on line length (default 15)
    SIFTA_DIALOGUE_OLLAMA_URL       Override (default 127.0.0.1:11434)
    SIFTA_DIALOGUE_FALLBACK_OK      If "0", raise on Ollama failure instead of
                                    falling back to stochastic templates.

def proof_of_property() -> Dict[str, bool]:
    """Mechanical regression guard for the 2026-04-21 stigmergic-dialogue fix.

    Asserts six invariants that together prevent the boot-greeting from
    silently lying about how often Alice and the Architect spoke yesterday:

      1. The greeting template never contains the literal `{turns}` slot —
         that field meant "last 10 minutes" but was being printed under
         the word "Yesterday". It must use `{turns_yesterday_phrase}` now.
      2. The grammar-aware phrase builders are present.
      3. `_summary` exposes both `convo_turns_yesterday` and
         `convo_turns_today` keys (independent of the rolling window).
      4. The yesterday count is GROUNDED — if the conversation ledger
         contains rows whose local-clock date is yesterday, the count
         must be > 0 (catches "we accidentally pointed at the wrong
         file/window again").
      5. The phrase builder never emits the literal substring "ZERO" or
         "spoke 0 times" for any input value of n (1, 0, 17, etc.).
      6. The conversation ledger path is the canonical
         `.sifta_state/alice_conversation.jsonl` — same defect class as
         the wallet split-brain.
